## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

  

STAM (SensorThings API Map) is a JavaScript library for showing the Things/Features of interest of a SensorThings server on a Leaflet/OpenLayers map.

  

## Features

  

* Easy implementation of an exising SensorThings server into a map

* Leaflet and OpenLayers are supported

* Things and Features of interest are supported

  

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

  

### Prerequisites

  

* A website

* A OpenLayers or Leaflet map

* A SensorThings server url

  

### Installing

  

#### In browser

  

Download the [minified file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataCoveEU/STAM/master/dist/stam.min.js), and include it in a script tag. This will expose the variable L.stam or ol.layer.STAM depending on the used map libary.

  

```html

<script  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataCoveEU/STAM/master/dist/stam.min.js"></script>

```

### Features

#### Point

A GeoJson with an extra property named getData. 

getData is a object, the keys are the observedProperties and the values are async functions.


These functions take a callback as a argument. The callback gets a predefined QueryObject as an argument, can change it and has to return it.

The function returns the data inside the value attribute. 

```js
var data = await feature.properties.getData['NO']((query)=>{
    query.filter = "phenomenonTime lt now()";
    query.resultFormat = 'dataArray';
    return query;
});
```

#### Cluster

GeoJSON with a property named 'count' with the Things/FeaturesOfInterest inside the cluster

### Config

The config is used to specify the style and behaviour of the displayed content
```js
{
	//Specify the range to plot. Offset OR endDate may be specified
	plot: {
		startDate: Date, //Starting date
		offset?: number, //Count of the observations to be plotted. Can be negative.
		endDate?: Date //End date to plot to
	},
	//Time in seconds to cache the data. Data is cached forever if null
	cachingDuration: number,
	//Defaults to true, if false no clustering is going to be applied
	cluster: boolean,
	//The minimal count of things in a cluster, so that a cluster is displayed
	clusterMin: number,
	//Can be a array of a ranges or directly a queryObject. Queries can be specified for given zoomlevels or ranges.
	queryObject: {
		entityType: string, //Entity type to Query. Can only be Things or FeaturesOfInterest
		filter?: string, //Filter
	}| Array<{
		//If a number, the query is used for only that zoom level
		zoomLevel: number | {
			from: number, //Must be specified, if to is not specified, the query is going to be used for every zoom level >= from
			to?: number //The highest zoom level the query should be used for
		},
		query: QueryObject //The query to be used
	}>,
	//The base url of the Sensorthings API
	baseUrl: string,
  //Specifies the color of the marker. The functions gets the geojson as a parameter and has to return the color. The function can be async.
  //Valid colors: green, black, blue, grey, violet, orange, red, yellow, gold
	markerStyle?: Function | string,
	//Used to style the cluster. Can be a function that returns the second specified interface
	clusterStyle?: Function | {
	//Used to specify the style of the circle. 
	circle: { //Path interface
				color: string, //Border color
				weight: number, //Weight of the borders
				opacity: number, //The border's opacity
				fillColor: string,
				fillOpacity: number,
	},
	polygon: {
				hover: Path, //The style of the polygon when the curser hovers over it
				default: Path //The default style
			}
	},
	//Called, with the feature as an argument, when a marker is hovered.
	markerMouseOver?: Function,
	//Called, with the feature as an argument, when a marker is clicked.
	markerClick?: Function,
	//Called, with the feature as an argument, when a cluster is hovered.
	clusterMouseOver?: Function,
	//Called, with the feature as an argument, when a cluster is clicked.
	clusterClick?: Function,
	//The instance of the openLayers map. Only necessary for openLayers. 
	map?: any
}
```  

### Usage

  

#### Leaflet

  

```js
L.stam(config)
```

  

#### OpenLayers

  

```js
new  ol.layer.STAM(config)
```
